# Advent Of Code 2019
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in the programming language of our choice. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

At Codam, in December of 2019, we started on solving problems in the Advent of Code platform and we had a private leaderboard to challeng each other every day during.
